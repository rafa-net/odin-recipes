# Odin-Recipes

## Project Overview
This website serves as my first project in The Odin Project curriculum, focusing on HTML. It features a collection of various dishes I've found online, presented through simple, yet effective HTML pages.

## Learning Objectives
The initial focus of this project is on HTML. I currently apply basic CSS styling to enhance readability, but I plan to revisit this project to significantly improve my CSS skills and deepen my understanding of web design.

## Future Plans
I plan to revisit this project to apply CSS skills I will acquire later in the curriculum. This will not only help me learn by doing but also enhance the visual appeal of the website.

## How to Contribute
If you have suggestions for recipes or improvements, feel free to fork this repository and submit a pull request.
